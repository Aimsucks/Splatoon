- By default, Splatoon comes with no presets or scripts preinstalled. It's on you to find and import ones that you want to use or create your own.
- Imported presets will not update automatically. Should new version become available, you will have to update it yourself.
- Imported (from official repo) scripts, however, will update automatically.
- Splatoon only operates on a client side. Other players can not see and can not interact with your presets and scripts. Server can not check whether you are using Splatoon or not.
- Splatoon only uses data you supply. Additionally, Splatoon uses only data that is available to you normally, without going beyond standard game client operations.
- It is advised against streaming or screen sharing while using Splatoon.
- Presets and scripts that can be used to deteriorate other player experience are not accepted.

## Information for Chinese players
Chinese fork of Dalamud currently intentionally prevents usage of Splatoon by adding it into banned plugins list. Banned plugin list was originally created to prevent unstable plugins from loading on updates. However, Chinese forkers of Dalamud decided to abuse it to attempt to prevent you from using the plugin for their personal reasons. 
### Easy way to unblock Splatoon and all other plugins:
Simply download this program https://github.com/NightmareXIV/UnbanPluginsCN/releases/latest and run it before you run the game/inject Dalamud. Just keep this program running and you should be good.
