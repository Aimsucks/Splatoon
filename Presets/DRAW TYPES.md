# Draw Types

This page will help you understand the different types of draws you can find in Splatoon and what they look like in game.

## Circles

Circle draws can mark areas of the map with a circular shape. They can be used in a variety of ways such as marking an area to stand that you know is safe or reminding you where a tower is going to spawn that you need to take. They can be permanent draws, which stay on the map for the entire fight or they can be triggered by a specific mechanic in a fight. Support on understanding triggers and how to use them can be found [here](https://github.com/HairyTofu/Splatoon/blob/2f8510dd0a5f497dff0dfcfdc1feec57c7912cba/Presets/TRIGGER%20TYPES.md).
