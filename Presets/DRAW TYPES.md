# Draw Types

This page will help you understand the different types of draws you can find in Splatoon and what they look like in game.

## Circles at fixed co-ordinates.

Circle draws can mark areas of the map with a circular shape. They can be used in a variety of ways such as marking an area to stand that you know is safe or reminding you where a tower is going to spawn that you need to take. They can be permanent draws, which stay on the map for the entire fight or they can be triggered by a specific mechanic in a fight. Support on understanding triggers and how to use them can be found [here](https://github.com/HairyTofu/Splatoon/blob/2f8510dd0a5f497dff0dfcfdc1feec57c7912cba/Presets/TRIGGER%20TYPES.md).

## Circles relative to an object

Circle draws can also be used so that they are relative to an object or NPC. This means that, as the NPC moves, the circle draw can move with them. This is particularly useful in fights that are boss relative, where you are having difficulty finding your position and need a quick reminder.
