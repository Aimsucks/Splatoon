# Contributing Presets

## General recommendations
- It's recommended to paint "unsafe" area rather than "safe", even if unsafe area is significantly bigger.
- Any layout that does not uses names or game's log lines (Splatoon's log lines are fine) can be marked as international right away.
- Please include brief description if your preset does something more than just displaying unsafe zones; just a few words. If a mechanic can be resolved in few different ways and you're resolving it in some specific way - please include strat's name or link to a guide or a screenshot. If you're shipping disabled by default elements, please tell users when they should enable them.
- Please consider using uniform layout group name across all layouts.
- If few layouts combined together form an uniform preset and it does not makes sense to import them separately, you can include them into a single code block, one layout per line.

## Freezes

- **Refreeze interval** is the cooldown for another freeze to happen if all of the same conditions are still met for that element.
- **Freeze for** is how long the element will display.
