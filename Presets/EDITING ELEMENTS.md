Once you have selected a draw type that you want, the next step is to edit the draw so it is more effective for what you want it to do.

- **Reference Position and Offsets**
   - These two options move the circular element along the X,Y and Z axis. These can be changed independently to enable you to precisely put the element where you want. The cursor icon allows you to place the element on the screen at the location of your cursor. This makes placing circular elements particularly easy.
- **Stroke**
   - This enables you to change the colour of the circular element. You might find it useful to colour the element green for a safespot, for example.

- **Thickness**
   - This changes the thickness of the line surrounding the element. Thicker lines might be easier to see on different maps.

- **Fill**
   - This changes the amount of colour within the element. At higher fill levels, you may not be able to see the floor at all.
